# DS-Silicon-Resistivity-Profiles
Resistivity, dopant densities and compensation level profiles in Double- and Triple-doped directionally solidified Silicon.

State of program: not finished! Not release!

This program allows you to calculate and display profiles of impurity concentrations, specific resistivity, 
net dopant density, as well as compensation level along the height of the silicon ingot obtained by directional solidification.

There are 2 possible calculations in the program.
1. You can set the desired custom values of ingot resistivity at two or three points along ingot height 
(for the case of silicon doping with two or three impurities). Program calculates required initial concentration 
for each dopant in silicon feedstock for achieving desired custom values of ingot resistivity. 
OR:
2. You can set custom concentration for each dopant in silicon feedstock. Program calculates values of ingot resistivity 
at two or three points along ingot height.

In both cases in the chart window, you can visualize one of the above profiles (resistivity, compensation e.t.c).
