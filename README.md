# DS-Silicon-Resistivity-Profiles
Resistivity, dopant densities and compensation level profiles in Double- and Triple-doped directionally solidified Silicon.

State of program: In Progress!

This program allows you to calculate and display profiles of impurity concentrations, specific resistivity, 
net dopant density, as well as compensation level along the height of the silicon ingot obtained by directional solidification.

There are two kinds of calculations in program.
1. You can set the desired CUSTOM VALUES OF INGOT SPECIFIC RESISTIVITY at two or three points along ingot height 
(for the case of silicon doping with two or three impurities). Program calculates required initial concentration 
for each dopant in silicon feedstock for achieving desired custom values of ingot resistivity. 
OR:
2. You can set CUSTOM CONCENTRATION )F EACH DOPANT in silicon feedstock before growth. Program calculates values of 
ingot resistivity at two or three points along ingot height.

In both cases in the chart window, you can visualize one of the above profiles (resistivity, compensation e.t.c) in chart area. In a separate window, the numerical values for the resistivity of the ingot are presented, depending on the ingot solidified fraction.

Possible doping options are:

Silicon feedstock with Boron (B), Phosphorus (P), Arsenic (As) and Gallium (Ga) in combinations:

- B + P
- B + As
- P + Ga
- As + Ga
- B + P + Ga
- B + As + Ga
